# Getting Started with the Backend Node App

Before running this application, we need to install all dependencies. Open your terminal and in this project directory, run

### `npm install`

Next, we want to initialize the database and populate it with the data we will use.

To do this, open your terminal and navigate to `/backend/db/createDatabase.js` and run `node createDatabase.js` or simply run 

### `npm run create_db`

Now, in the same directory, we can run:

### `npm run dev`

This will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

To run test cases, use:

### `npm run test`
